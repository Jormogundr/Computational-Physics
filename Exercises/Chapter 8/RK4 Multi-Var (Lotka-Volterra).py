"""
This program demonstrates the implementation of the Runge-Katta 4th order method by applying it to solve the Lotka-Volterra equations, which model populations of predator/prey species and how
the growth/decline of one has such an affect on the other members of the ecosystem being modelled. 

The rabbit population (x) and fox population (y) make up the vector r(x,y). The equations in this case are time independent, nonetheless we still plot their population against time.

Then, dr/dt = f(r(x,y),t) -- where f is a vector valued function f = <fx, fy>.

First we define some growth constants, then implement RK4. The plot is generated as well.
